dotfiles
========
These are my configuration files.  They can be installed by cloning the repository 
to your home directory.  Executing makesymlinks.sh will make symbolic links to the 
dotfiles.

    git clone https:https://github.com/dylanchase/dotfiles
    
Create symlinks to the dotfiles and copy the old dotfiles into /dotfiles/old

    ./dotfiles/makesymlinks.sh
